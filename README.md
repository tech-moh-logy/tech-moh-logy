## The Discovery:
I still recall the day when I first became inquisitive about coding. I was browsing the internet and I stumbled upon an article about how coding is the future of technology. I was intrigued, but I had no idea what coding was all about. That is when I decided to do some research. I read about how coding is a language that allows you to communicate with computers and how it is used to create websites, software, and mobile applications. I was amazed by the endless possibilities. But the more I read, the more I realized that coding was not just a skill, it was an art. It was not just about typing lines of code, but also about solving problems, creating new things, and shaping the future.
